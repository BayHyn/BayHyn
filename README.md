# Memory Library

**The librarian is BayHyn — that's me**

*—— Custodian of those scattered memory archives that belong to characters and stories around the world*

## Overview

The Memory Library stores and indexes the “archive repositories” and character memories within the WentUrc world.

Here you can look up almost any archive and backup related to the astrbot plugin and its associated materials.

## Which archives will not be backed up?

* When multiple repositories exist within the same fork network, only one of them can be selected for backup.
* Repositories that were deleted before the first backup began will not be included.
* Repositories not listed in `plugin.json` will not be automatically included in backups.

## How it works (how to view and verify)

* To review the implementation details and how it works, refer to the running repository: `https://github.com/BayHyn/fork-repo`.
* To view the specific automation run logs, check the workflow file and its run history: `https://github.com/BayHyn/fork-repo/actions/workflows/fork.yml`.

## Compliance & Disclaimer

This library follows open-source licenses and strives to preserve and distribute archives in a lawful and compliant manner. If you discover any concerns or issues while using or archiving materials, please inform us promptly.

## Report Issues or Submit Feedback

If you find any anomalies or archives that need to be added, please open a new issue in the fork-repo repository; BayHyn will do their best to handle it.
